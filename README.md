## Hey there, I'm ValÃ©ria CustÃ³dio ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Researcher and data analyst interested in providing companies with insights taken from data using my experimental design, data visualization, and statistics skills.

My bachelor's was in Biology. In my PhD, I focused mainly on unraveling microbial and environmental cues regulating maize development by generating and analyzing layers of omics and physiological datasets. This gave me access to learn R and Python programming languages and made me discover the world of statistics, data analysis, and machine learning.

Feel free to browse my repositories and reach out to me if you'd like to collaborate!
